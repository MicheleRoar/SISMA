# SISMA – Music Discovery & Planner

SISMA is a music recommendation and scheduling system based on audio features
(danceability, energy, mood, BPM, etc.) designed for commercial environments
such as restaurants and cafés.

The system is composed of two main modules:

- **Discovery**: generates feature-consistent playlists
- **Planner**: schedules playlists over time slots (daily / weekly)

The engine uses hard and soft constraints, negative filters, genre continuity,
and popularity-aware artist balancing.

## Stack
- Python (Flask)
- Pandas / NumPy
- Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS
- Spotify-style audio features dataset

## Status
Active development 🚧
